# Project: Tic Tac Toe

## About the Project
In this project, we build a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes. This assignment is based on the [Odin project's Ruby Object Oriented Programming assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).
